#  Emoji Palette
This plugin adds a panel on the main client navbar (right-hand side, with all the icons) listing all the emojis inthe client.

Hover over the image to get the trigger text.

Unfortunately it's not possible to insert the emoji into the chat on-click.

It should auto-update as new emojis are added.
